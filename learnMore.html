    <h1>Why You Need to Sign in</h1>
    <p>
        In order to access the Spotify database, you need a Spotify account. In theory I could use my own credentials, 
        but doing so would reveal information that would compromise my account.
        The method of authorization this app uses is safe for you though. After you sign in to the Spotify servers with OAuth,
        they send a temporary access token that is only good for an hour, and the only thing that token grants me access to
        is your most basic account info, and this app doesn't even look at that stuff. I don't do anything shady with info like sell it to a third
        party, the only time this app accesses the internet is to pull data from Spotify. If you still don't believe me, 
        you can check out the source code for this app on Github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/donovanwest/EverythingsConnected">here</a>
