    <h1>Everything's Connected Info</h1>
    <p>
        In order to access the Spotify database, you need a Spotify account. In theory I could use my own credentials, 
        but doing so would reveal information that would compromise my account.
        The method of authorization this app uses is safe for you though. After you sign in to the Spotify servers with OAuth,
        they send a tempoary access token that is only good for an hour, and the most invasive thing that token grants me is access to
        read your playlists, not modify them (Currently I don't even read them yet). I don't do anything shady with that info like sell it to a third
        party, the only time this app access the internet is to pull data from Spotify. If you still don't believe me, 
        you can check out the source code for this app on Github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/donovanwest/EverythingsConnected">here</a>
