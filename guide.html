    <h2>What it Does</h2>
    <p>
        This app allows you to find all the artists that someone has collaborated with on Spotify.
        It uses the Spotify API (the part of their database the public can see), to scan through all 
        of an artist's songs and pull out every artist that was featured on them. You then have to ability to
        do the same thing to any those artists, and create a big network showing how a lot of artists have
        some connection to another. It's kinda like the famous Kevin Bacon Number. You have to log in 
        to spotify use the app. For more information on why check <a href="learnMore.hmtl">here</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few ways to use this app. After you've logged in you type in any artist's name 
        and their bubble will appear, then it will do it's search for all of their collaborators. Depending
        on how prolific the artist is, this might take a few seconds.
    </p>
    <h3>One at a Time Mode</h3>
    <p>
        This will only show the artists within 1 degree of separation from the typed artist, then you can
        click on any of those artists to expand how many degrees of separation they have. It's my recommneded
        mode since it runs faster and it's easier to see the information
    </p>
    <h3>Full Search Mode</h3>
    <p>
        This will keep doing a recursive search on every artist found up to a certain degrees of separation.
        This can be cool to see the shear number of artists in the network, but it takes a 
        while and it's hard to see what's going on when there's a couple thousand nodes. You can set the limit
        with the slide. I only recommend going to two degrees unless your willing to wait a while 
    </p>
    <h3>Show Images</h3>
    <p>
        Pretty simple. Shows images of the artist in their node. It looks better, but at a high
        volume it can drastically lower the framerate. When this is off each node will be a unique
        color based on it's degrees of separation
    </p>
    <h3>Base Circle Size on Popularity</h3>
    <p>
        Spotify assigns every artist a popularity score between 0 and 100. With this on the radius of
        each circle will be equal to that popularity. This can help you pick out the more
        famous artists. If you want equal representation then you can turn this off and 
        each circle will be the same size
    </p>
    <h3>Name of song connecting them</h3>
    <p>
        If you click on the line between two artists, it will show the name of the song they collaborated on
        in the sidebar. It will also play a 30 second sample of that song. It's quite possible they collaborated on more than one song, but this just shows 
        the first instance that Spotify returns.
    </p>
    <h3>Delete</h3>
    <p>
        The trash can icon. Will delete the entire network and start over
    </p>
    <h3>mute</h3>
    <p>
        Mutes the audio from playing songs.
    </p>

    <h3>Zoom In/Out</h3>
    <p>
        (Currently doens't work properly, but it might still help a bit). You can zoom in and out by scrolling with a mouse or trackpad, but it can be a little
        finicky since you can't scroll while hovering over a node or line. These buttons can help
        get you out of a bind if you're two zoomed in and can find any white space.
    </p>

    <h3>Games You Can Play</h3>
    <p>
        I have fun putting it on the one at a time mode, and trying to find a way to connect two
        disparate artists. You'd be amazed at some of the connections you can make with only
        a few degrees.
        <br><br>
        Typically you can go functionally forever expading nodes until you reach a point where 
        you have virtually every artist represented, but you're browser would probably crash 
        before that happened. I want to put a challenge out there to find the artist with the 
        largest network you can with no more connections to be found. This means expanding every artist 
        until there's no more. I bet you can't find an artist with more than 5 initial connections that
        satisfies this.
        <br><br>
        Kevin Bacon hasn't released any of his own songs on Spotify as of now, but he's appeared on a few. This means
        that you can use this app to find a musician's Bacon Number, though it's a bit tricky since he hasn't collaborated with a lot.
