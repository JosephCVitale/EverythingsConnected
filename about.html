        This project was made for the senior project class at Kansas State University. I worked on
        it througout the semseter. As of right now it's just being hosted through Github Pages, but I
        may decide to pay for it to be hosted somewhere real one day.

        I had a vague idea for this early in 2020. I noticed that a lot of artists that I liked had 
        worked with each other in some way, so I wanted to make a graph to represent that. I made the 
        following image in May

        I made it using LucidChart. It took me like two days between research and tweaking visuals,
        then I hit the shape limit on the free version I even had to leave off some artists. I 
        kept thinking that there must be a way to do it automatically with the Spotify API.
        Over the summer I starting working on it in C# and got a basic version of the algorithm
        working, but it was very slow. It took like 35 minutes to complete, and I didn't even know
        how I would display it. Then when I started the Fall 2020 semester I decided to 
        use this idea again for my senior project. If you want to look at the source code,
        the repo is up on Github <a href="https://github.com/donovanwest/EverythingsConnected">here</a>.
        I've never used Javascript before, so don't make fun of my code too much.
